# Portfolio Website Generation Prompt

**Objective:**  
Generate a single-page portfolio website for Satya Ravi, focused on showcasing skills, creativity, and advanced UX sensibility.  
The site should be dark, sleek, modern, and visually inspiring, with scroll-based frame transitions and interactive elements that highlight both technical depth and design intuition.

---

## 1. **Overall Style & UX**

- **Theme:** Dark matted look (`#101010` or deep charcoal), modern glassmorphism (blurred, semi-transparent cards), high contrast for headlines and accents (bright blue or teal), bold modern sans-serif fonts (Inter, Satoshi, or Space Grotesk).
- **Layout:** Single-page application (SPA) with smooth scroll-based transitions; each section should feel like a cinematic “frame” update, with motion tying the sections together (Framer Motion or GSAP style).
- **Components:**  
  - Hero with left/right split (portrait/photo on right, intro/copy on left)
  - Animated, glassy “Core Strengths” tiles
  - Section transitions where key visual elements (like the portrait) animate their position/opacity between frames
  - Interactive AI chatbot widget in the final section
- **Details:**  
  - Navigation dots/scroll cues for section jumping
  - Responsive: Must look equally stunning on mobile/tablet/desktop
  - Subtle microinteractions: Buttons glow on hover, cards gently tilt, etc.
  - Light/dark mode toggle optional (default is dark)

---

## 2. **Transitions**

- **Hero to Core Strengths:**  
  Portrait smoothly slides/fades from right to left; text content animates out/in.
- **Core Strengths to Skill Sections:**  
  Portrait shifts position (shrinks and fades into background or edge), animated skill tiles appear with staggered entrance.
- **Each Section Change:**  
  Cinematic frame update—main elements animate into place (fade, slide, or scale), headline animates with slight delay.
- **Final Section:**  
  Portrait morphs into an interactive chatbot (“RaviBot”), ready for conversation.
